# Pokemon Adventure

## How Pokemon Adventure works, and its build
This is like a mini game of Pokemon
- A user can sign up and log in to play the game
- Pick a Starter Pokemon (A Trainer can only hold one pokemon)
- Trainer then can go to their Town, Walk in the Tall Grass (where there is roaming pokemon), battle pokemon, and look at their Pokedex
- While walking in the tall grass, a random pokemon at a random time is found which leads to the battle phase where you fight, or you run
- Whenever a new pokemon is found, the Pokedex (Cache) is updated to store that pokemon's information
